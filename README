tchat is an ncurses based interface to google voice. It uses
pygooglevoice (and thus polling and screen scraping) to interface
with google voice. It presents an interface similar to chat clients
(e.g. pidgin, mcabber), allowing you to "chat" via text messages.

It uses a password stored in python keyring. Specifically, it
requires that the password for the 'gmail' service and your supplied
username (currently a constant in tchat.py) be your password to
login. You can do this by booting up python:

tycho@mittens:~$ python
Python 2.6.5 (r265:79063, Apr 16 2010, 13:57:41) 
[GCC 4.4.3] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import keyring
>>> keyring.set_password("gmail", "tycho@tycho.ws", "secret")

tchat displays only the most recent "conversation". It seems that
google voice resets these every 497 messages; tchat should seamlessly
move on to the next conversation, so you don't miss a beat.
